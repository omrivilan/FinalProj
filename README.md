# Stock Analysis and Forecasting Application
This is a Streamlit-based tool that helps you analyze and forecast stock performance, especially for companies in the Israeli (TA) stock market. The application combines powerful machine learning models like LSTM, GRU, XGBoost, LightGBM, and ARIMA to give detailed insights into stock trends and predictions. It’s designed to make complex stock analysis easier for anyone to understand.

## What Can This App Do?
With this app, you can look at the actual stock performance, compare it with model predictions, and even see future forecasts. If you’re interested in analyzing a whole market sector, the app can show trends and insights for companies in that sector. You can also compare the performance of different stocks side by side.

To make things even better, there’s an AI-powered chatbot that you can interact with. You can ask questions about specific stocks or sectors, and the chatbot will not only give you answers but also generate graphs and suggestions for you.

## How Does It Work?
The app uses machine learning models to analyze stock data. For example, it uses LSTM and GRU to work with time-series data, and XGBoost and LightGBM for more structured data analysis. These models help the app make predictions about stock performance based on historical data.

The app also includes tools to visualize this information. You can see dynamic graphs showing actual performance, predicted values, and even future trends. These graphs are synchronized across different models and time frames, so you always get a clear and accurate picture.

## How Do I Use It?
Getting started is simple. First, make sure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed on your computer. You’ll also need to install some libraries like pandas, streamlit, and matplotlib. Once everything is ready, you can run the app and start exploring.

You can ask the chatbot things like:

"Show me the performance of [Company Name]."
"Compare [Company1] and [Company2]."
"What are the trends in the [Sector Name] sector?"
The app will generate graphs and summaries for you in response to these questions.

Why Use This App?
This app is great for anyone who wants to understand stock trends without needing to be a financial expert. Whether you’re an investor, a student, or just curious about how stocks work, this tool provides clear insights backed by advanced models. The interactive chatbot makes it easy to explore and understand complex data.
